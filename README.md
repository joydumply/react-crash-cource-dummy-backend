# React Crash Course Dummy Backend

This is a dummy backend which was in the [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-react-the-complete-guide/) that I learned.

You also need a [React Crash](https://github.com/joydumply/react-crash-cource) project to see how does it work.

Just start it on your local machine, so you can fetch data from it, or store new posts
